# 2-7_introduction_to_pytorch

## Quick Start

### Datasets

The datasets will be downloaded automatically when running the scripts.

### Execute one of the provided scripts

This lecture was split into multiple small tasks that each introduced another feature of PyTorch. I summarized most of this steps in one script and included the detailed comments provided by Udacity. To run this script do the following:

```
cd 2-7_intro
python introduction_training.py
```

This script will train on the MNIST dataset for 1 epoch and display a classification result.
