# deep_learning_nano_degree

This repository contains exercises that I completed during [Udacity's Nano Degree program on Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). Some of these exercises were part of the program while others were additional things that I tried based on the given tasks.

## Description

The exercises contained in this repository are very diverse. I provide a detailed description in the README.md files of each of the subfolders along with my reasoning for the presented solutions.

## Acknowledgments

The original repository of this Nano Degree program can be found here

```

Since I was learning pytorch during that course, many of my solutions are embedded into the original task descriptions of Udacity. Further, my code is very similar in style and structure to what I learned during that program.

## Installation

TODO
