# 02_neural_networks

Exercises and solutions from lecture 2 of the Nano Degree program.

## Description

### 2-5_project_1_predicting_bike_sharing_patterns

This folder contains my solution to the first project with "pure" Python and additionally with PyTorch.

### 2-6_sentiment_analysis

The goal of this lecture was to build a sentiment analysis network. Special focus was put on data preparation. I additionally provide a PyTorch implementation.

### 2-7_introduction_to_pytorch

First, I present a script that summarizes most of the concepts that were shown in this lecture. Then I present two differen multi layer perceptron (MLP) implementations for MNIST and FMNIST each. Finally, there are scripts to evaluate the hyperparameters of the implementations.
